## Relevent Work:

Boston Weather ETL Pipeline
This project automates the collection and processing of Boston weather data. Historical data from NOAA and real-time data from the Open-Meteo API are ingested, stored in AWS S3, and processed via AWS Glue into structured formats. The pipeline runs daily, ensuring up-to-date datasets for analysis and visualization. Processed data powers a Streamlit dashboard for monitoring current weather conditions, and the system includes logging, scheduling, and alerting to ensure reliability. This ETL workflow provides a robust, automated solution for maintaining high-quality, ready-to-use weather data for research or operational use.

The chart above shows the daily maximum (TMAX) and minimum (TMIN) temperatures in Boston for a given month. The lighter line represents the daily highs, while the darker line shows the daily lows. Peaks indicate warmer days, and valleys indicate cooler days. This visualization highlights temperature variability and trends over the month, providing a quick way to spot unusually hot or cold days.This shows November of 2025. 

This chart is part of the interactive Boston Weather Dashboard, where users can filter by year and month, view precipitation, and see daily weather flags (“Above”, “Below”, “Average”) for deeper insights.
