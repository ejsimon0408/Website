## Relevent Work:

Boston Weather ETL Pipeline
This project automates the collection and processing of Boston weather data. Historical data from NOAA and real-time data from the Open-Meteo API are ingested, stored in AWS S3, and processed via AWS Glue into structured formats. The pipeline runs daily, ensuring up-to-date datasets for analysis and visualization. Processed data powers a Streamlit dashboard for monitoring current weather conditions, and the system includes logging, scheduling, and alerting to ensure reliability. This ETL workflow provides a robust, automated solution for maintaining high-quality, ready-to-use weather data for research or operational use.
